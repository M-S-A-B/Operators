Aim: Getting started with C++
Theory: Different operators in C++.
The different operators that we used are :
addition: '+'
subtraction: '-'
multiplication: '*'
division: '/'
modulus: '%'
less than:'<'
greater than: '>'
less than equal to:'<='
greater than equal to: '>='
bitwise: '&'
and: '&&'
or: '||'

These are the different opertiors that can be used as arithmetic operators, assignment operators, bitwise operators.


Algorithm:

Start => define variables for each operator => assign operation to each variable => print output of all the variables => End

Explanation of the algorithm:
First we include the header file. Then we define different variables for different operators. We assign different operations to different variables. Then we print the outputs of all the varibles.
